# FROGGER ARCADE GAME
By Jeremy Levett

## About
This is a take on the classic arcade game Frogger. It required HTML, CSS, JS and Canvas skills. The image resource management file and a basic loop engine file (that was worked on later by myself) was provided prior to starting the project.

Udacity Project Reviewer comment:
_"It was a great submission and I'm happy to say it meets all specifications. You went above and beyond and kicked things up a notch. It is always a pleasure to review submissions where we see such great amount of hard work. There is very less to say about an awesome submission!"_

## How to play

Use the arrow keys to get across the water (for 20 points) whilst avoiding the evil bugs that can hurt you. The bugs move faster every time you cross successfully.

You can get an extra 10 points for every sparkley gem you collect. You only have 90 seconds per game. Spacebar will pause the game. Esc gets you back to the main menu.

## Run
